# My day

 I had a great day today! My first day in a long time waking up at 5:30.
 I did my usual mornign routine, made some coffee and breakfast and got right to class!
> Breakfast 
my breakfast consisted of 
* Eggs
* Beans
* 2 Tortillas
* Seasonings and hot sauce

 Class today has been pretty straightforward for the most part. Any issues I had were quickly fixed by my team!

``` Coded a bunch of html and got more practice using git commands! ```
